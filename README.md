# Multi-Head-CNN-Model-for-CIFAR-100-Classification
This repository implements a multi-head CNN for CIFAR-100 image classification, leveraging separate output heads for different class subsets. It includes dataset preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a severity-based misclassification penalty to improve accuracy.
